# Mixed Messages Portfolio Project

## Project Objectives

* Message generator program using JS
* Git version control
* Command Line Practice
* Build in self-configured local development environment

## Requirements:

* Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output.
* The message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data.

### Planning

1. Concept - WSB themed, to commemorate the Gamestop madness.  The message generator will combine a stock symbol, either bid or ask at bounded random size, and one of the 20 possible magic 8-ball phrases.
2. Schedule - 7 tasks in Codecademy kanban board, I should be able to complete at least 3 per day.  Starting 2021/2/1.
