# codecademyProjects

## JS, Now with HTML/CSS

1. credit-card-checker-starter
    * Luhn checksum project
    * Array focused exercises
2. mystery-organism-starter
    * DNA string manipulation
    * Object focused exercises, esp. object methods
    * Personally found the mystery-organism-starter waaay easier than credit-card-checker-starter, but I think that was just a product of struggling through the credit card project and carrying over what I had learned.
3. mixed-messages
    * Memorializing the GME event
    * Code generates a randomized Magic 8 Ball stock pick
4. dasmotos-arts-and-crafts
    * Branching out into HTML/CSS
    * Pretty barebones, and what a break from the struggle-bus compared to JS!
5. excursions
    * HTML/CSS landing page for app in development
