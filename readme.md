# codecademyProjects

1. credit-card-checker-starter
    * Luhn checksum project
    * Array focused exercises
2. mystery-organism-starter
    * DNA string manipulation
    * Object focused exercises, esp. object methods
    * Personally found the mystery-organism-starter waaay easier than credit-card-checker-starter, but I think that was just a product of struggling through the credit card project and carrying over what I had learned.
